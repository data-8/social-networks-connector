    "**Optional challenge question** If you have time, try to see if you can come up with other node-level quantities that do an even better job of telling you who should be innoculated to prevent large epidemic outbreaks. You might find these node-level metrics from earlier labs, or by looking at other functions available in the networkx package. Test your suggestion by using innoculation simulations, following the pattern above."
